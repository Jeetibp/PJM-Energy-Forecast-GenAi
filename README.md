# PJM-Energy-Forecast-GenAi
PJM energy forecasting dashboard using XGBoost and GenAI. Accurate 30-day load forecasts, scenario analysis, interactive Q&amp;A, and business report generation for PJM grid data.

üöÄ Overview
This project delivers a robust, business-ready dashboard for forecasting hourly energy demand across the PJM Interconnection (covering 13 US states and DC), using advanced machine learning and GenAI:

XGBoost-based 30-day hourly load forecasting (MAPE ‚âà 1%).

Scenario analysis: Simulate uncertainty and demand shifts.

Peak detection, trend insights, and downloadable reports.

GenAI (Llama-3) integration: Ask natural language questions about forecasts or the full dataset, and get automated business reports.

üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
PJMW_hourly.csv (sample) and PJMW_MW_Hourly.xlsx (sample)

Columns: Datetime, MW (hourly grid load, MW)

Coverage: 2002‚Äì2011, hourly data for the full PJM grid.
